//! This crate provides a cross-platform API for dealing with buffers backed by raw virtual memory.
//!
//! Apart from providing protection and isolation between processes, paging, and memory mapped
//! hardware, virtual memory serves to solve another critical issue: the issue of the virtual
//! buffer. It allows us to [reserve] a range of memory only in the process's virtual address
//! space, without actually [committing] any of the memory. This can be used to create a buffer
//! that's infinitely growable and shrinkable *in-place*, without wasting any physical memory, nor
//! even overcommitting any memory. It can also be used to create sparse data structures that don't
//! overcommit memory.
//!
//! The property of growing in-place is very valuable when reallocation is impossible, for example
//! because the data structure needs to be concurrent or otherwise pinned. It may also be of use
//! for single-threaded use cases if reallocation is too expensive (say, tens to hundreds of MB).
//! However, it's probably easier to use something like [`Vec::with_capacity`] in that case.
//!
//! See also [the `vec` module] for an implementation of a concurrent vector.
//!
//! # Reserving
//!
//! Reserving memory involves allocating a range of virtual address space, such that other
//! allocations within the same process can't reserve any of the same virtual address space for
//! anything else. Memory that has been reserved has zero memory cost, however, it can't be
//! accessed. In order to access any of the pages, you will have to commit them first.
//!
//! # Committing
//!
//! A range of reserved memory can be committed to make it accessible. Memory that has been freshly
//! committed doesn't use up any physical memory. It merely counts towards overcommitment, which
//! may increase the likelihood of being OOM-killed, and may take up space for page tables and may
//! use some space in the page file. A committed page is only ever backed by a physical page after
//! being written to for the first time (being "faulted"), or when it was [prefaulted].
//!
//! Committed memory can be committed again without issue, so there is no need to keep track of
//! which pages have been committed in order to safely commit some of them.
//!
//! # Decommitting
//!
//! A range of committed memory can be decommitted, making it inaccessible again, and releasing any
//! physical memory that may have been used for them back to the operating system. Decommitted
//! memory is still reserved.
//!
//! Reserved but uncommitted memory can be decommitted without issue, so there is no need to keep
//! track of which pages have been committed in order to safely decommit some of them.
//!
//! # Unreserving
//!
//! Memory that is unreserved is available for new allocations to reserve again.
//!
//! Committed memory can be unreserved without needing to be decommitted first. However, it's not
//! possible to unreserve a range of reserved memory, only the entire allocation.
//!
//! # Prefaulting
//!
//! By default, each committed page is only ever backed by physical memory after it was first
//! written to. Since this happens for every page, and can be slightly costly due to the overhead
//! of a context switch, operating systems provide a way to *prefault* multiple pages at once.
//!
//! # Pages
//!
//! A page refers to the granularity at which the processor's Memory Management Unit operates and
//! varies between processor architectures. As such, virtual memory operations can only affect
//! ranges that are aligned to the *page size*.
//!
